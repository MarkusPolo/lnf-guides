## TL;DR

> There’s still no release date or window for *Light No Fire*. The official Steam page lists the launch as “To be announced,” and there have been no dated assets, preorders, or ratings-board entries that typically precede a locked window. The game skipped Summer Game Fest 2025, which is a common venue for date reveals; that absence doesn’t prove a delay, but it does weigh against a surprise 2025 launch. The most defensible read, based on public signals and standard marketing cadences, is patience: watch for a window at a major show (The Game Awards or SGF), then expect a multi-month runway before release. Until a storefront flips from TBA to a month or quarter, treat circulating dates as rumor. For current platform status in one place, see our concise [platforms guide](/guides/questions/platforms/).

## Where things stand

*Light No Fire* was unveiled at The Game Awards 2023 as a fantasy survival sandbox set on a single, Earth-scale planet. Around reveal, Sean Murray said the team had already been working on it for “the last five years,” a framing that emphasized scope rather than schedule. Nearly two years on, that tone hasn’t changed: no window, no platform confirmations beyond PC/Steam, and no public-facing milestones that usually telegraph an incoming date. The Steam listing remains TBA, which is the cleanest single indicator that timing is still fluid. Put simply, official channels have talked about ambition, not timing—and that’s consistent with Hello Games’ caution after No Man’s Sky’s bumpy 2016 launch: ship when it’s ready, not when the calendar says so. If you need a primer on what the game actually is, start with [What is Light No Fire?](/guides/questions/what-is-light-no-fire/).

## Event and storefront signals

Dates for ambitious games often surface first at tentpole events or via quiet storefront changes. In 2025, *Light No Fire* didn’t appear at Summer Game Fest, a moment many publishers use to lock in Q4/Q1 windows. That absence fueled community speculation toward 2026+, but absence alone isn’t evidence of delay—it’s merely the lack of a marketing beat. On the storefront side, SteamDB continues to mirror the official “To be announced” status; there’s no trace of a hidden date string, ratings update, or package configuration that typically precedes a public window. For tracking purposes, watch three things: a dated asset on Steam, a ratings-board entry, or a placement at The Game Awards. Any one of those would constitute a material change from today’s “TBA” posture. For what the first trailer actually shows (and what it doesn’t), see our [trailer breakdown](/guides/questions/trailer-analysis/).

## What the studio is showing—via No Man’s Sky

The biggest 2025 developments are technical, not temporal. With the **Voyagers** update, Hello Games shipped fully walkable, buildable Corvette-class ships with interior outfitting and multi-crew play, then followed up with rapid hotfixes—evidence of an actively evolving engine and tools. Crucially, the studio has said tech introduced for No Man’s Sky is being shared with *Light No Fire*. In the same news cycle, Sean Murray highlighted “real oceans” in *Light No Fire* that will require large, crewed boats to cross—systems that rhyme with the scale and simulation challenges Voyagers tackles. The net read: parallel development and cross-pollination aimed at systems fidelity, not a marketing sprint. That’s supportive of eventual quality and scope, but neutral on near-term scheduling. Track future NMS patches for features (water, physics, large-vehicle AI, networking) that map one-to-one to *LNF*’s needs. 

## A grounded forecast

With the Steam page still on TBA and no event-stage reveal in mid-2025, a 2025 launch now looks unlikely. The most plausible optimistic path is a date or window announced at The Game Awards 2025, followed by a marketing runway into mid-to-late 2026. If TGA passes quietly, reset expectations toward 2027. That isn’t a leak—just a synthesis of how modern launches are staged: storefronts and ratings light up first, partner beats and previews follow, then a firm date lands once localization, certification, and live-ops are confident. Until the Steam listing changes or Hello Games publishes a dated asset, treat every timeline as provisional. When a shift happens, it will almost certainly show up on Steam and in official posts before it hits rumor threads.
