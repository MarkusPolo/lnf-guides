## TL;DR

If you only skim one paragraph, read this, Light No Fire is officially listed on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719590/Light_No_Fire/), so PC is in, nothing else is confirmed in writing yet, which is why you do not see platform logos on recent coverage, the safest working model is PC first, then PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series once Hello Games is ready to lock certification and marketing beats, Nintendo’s newer hardware is plausible later given the studio’s track record with demanding ports, but that will depend on performance budgets and engine work. Watch for quiet tells before any press release, updated store metadata, ratings board entries, or a platform badge on a new trailer, those usually land weeks before a formal date.

## Will it be on PC

Yes, PC is the only platform confirmed, the Steam page is live and carries the familiar “Planned Release Date, To be announced” language, which is Valve’s standard placeholder when a publisher has not committed to a window. In practical terms, that means wishlists are the main signal Hello Games will monitor while it hardens tech and plans a marketing runway, this mirrors how the team handled No Man’s Sky updates over the years, slow, steady, and data informed. Expect the usual PC ecosystem advantages at launch, flexible settings, rapid hotfix cadence, and quick iteration as telemetry flows in from early players. For readers tracking status, store page copy, date strings, and package configurations tend to change first, then you see a ratings entry, then platform partner posts, that sequence is your early warning system. You can keep an eye on the official page here, [Light No Fire on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719590/Light_No_Fire/).

## Will it be on Xbox

There is no Xbox announcement today, however history points to strong odds, No Man’s Sky expanded to Xbox One in 2018 and to current generation hardware in 2020, and Hello Games has maintained feature parity and cross platform momentum since, which shows the studio is comfortable shipping on Microsoft’s platforms. Before you assume a day one release, look for three concrete breadcrumbs that usually precede it, a ratings board listing that includes Xbox, an updated trailer description that lists platforms, and first party posts on Xbox Wire.  

**Case study, rollout pace to inform expectations**  
| Title | Platform | First release year | Source |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| No Man’s Sky | Xbox One | 2018 | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky) |  
| No Man’s Sky | Xbox Series X/S | 2020 | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky) |  

This is not a promise for Light No Fire, it is a pattern that explains why many analysts model a staggered PC plus console plan.

## Will it be on Playstation 5

PlayStation is a strong candidate, but again, not confirmed for Light No Fire, the context matters, No Man’s Sky launched on PS4 and later received a PS5 version with ongoing enhancements, and Sony documented the next gen feature set in detail on the PlayStation Blog, see the archival announcement, [No Man’s Sky, The Next Generation](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/28/no-mans-sky-the-next-generation/). Hello Games is independent, so platform targets are business and engineering calls rather than first party mandates, that independence makes simultaneous PC and PS5 plausible once timing and certification line up. If you follow platform coverage cycles, Sony typically highlights third party titles in State of Play or on the PlayStation Blog when dates firm up, so an appearance there would be a reliable tell. Until an official platform list appears on the Light No Fire site or in a fresh trailer description, treat PS5 as probable but unannounced.

## Will it be on the Switch

For Nintendo hardware the right way to think about it is feasibility first, commitment second, Hello Games pulled off what many thought was impossible when it brought No Man’s Sky to the original Switch in 2022, and in June 2025 the studio shipped a proper Switch 2 edition alongside the Beacon update, both moves are documented on official channels, see the post, [No Man’s Sky, Beacon](https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/06/no-mans-sky-beacon/), and Nintendo’s store listing for the [Switch 2 Edition](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/). Light No Fire’s tech ambitions include a single planet at Earth scale and “real oceans” that require large boats and crews, those systems are heavier than typical survival sandboxes, which makes a later, optimized Nintendo version more plausible than a simultaneous launch. If a Nintendo build is coming, you will likely see it telegraphed by a product page or a short developer post before any influencer buzz.
