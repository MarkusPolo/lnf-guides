## TL;DR

Light No Fire is being built by [Hello Games](https://hellogames.org/), the independent studio based in Guildford with a smaller satellite in Cambridge. The game was revealed at [The Game Awards 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EurwCUKajdc), and the studio continues to present it as a small, tightly knit team taking on a very large simulation. If you want more than a nameplate, the sections below unpack who leads the project, how the team executes work with limited headcount, and which public breadcrumbs genuinely reflect progress. In short, Hello Games communicates sparingly and ships steadily, so understanding their process, culture, and track record is more useful than chasing rumor threads.

## Who is making it, and how did they get here

Hello Games develops and publishes Light No Fire, the studio is proudly independent and sets scope on its own timelines, which explains the restrained messaging around platforms and release windows. The company was founded in 2008 by Sean Murray, Grant Duncan, Ryan Doyle, and David Ream, a concise origin story you can verify on the [About Us](https://hellogames.org/about-us/) page and in the [Hello Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Games) entry that catalogues its projects, Joe Danger, [No Man’s Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky), and The Last Campfire. Murray serves as managing director and the public face at reveals, including the Light No Fire announcement post on the studio blog, which followed the TGA stage moment by a few days, you can read it here, [Announcing… Light No Fire](https://hellogames.org/2023/12/12/announcing-light-no-fire/). For the project’s own framing, start with the official site and press kit, both emphasize a fantasy planet at Earth scale and a design that blends survival sandbox freedom with RPG depth, see [lightnofire.com](https://lightnofire.com/) and the accompanying [press page](https://lightnofire.com/press).

## How this team builds large worlds with a small footprint

Light No Fire follows a production pattern Hello Games refined on No Man’s Sky, compact core staff, heavy investment in proprietary tech, and iterative shipping. Rather than constant hype cycles, the studio leaves a trail of operational tells that precede big announcements. Watch for three signals that reliably surface first, 1) role openings on the [Join Us](https://hellogames.org/join-us/) hub, graphics or engine listings often correlate with low level systems maturing, 2) official posts that discuss concrete simulation problems, which imply a vertical slice is stabilizing, 3) ratings board entries or storefront metadata changes, usually the last public step before certification. To keep it practical, here is a quick decoder for the most common breadcrumbs you will see.

| Public signal you can track | What it usually means in practice |
| --- | --- |
| New engine or graphics roles on the careers page | Tooling and rendering features are being hardened for wider team use |
| Blog or press kit updates with specific system details | A vertical slice is stable enough to discuss without walking it back later |
| Storefront or ratings board updates | A build is moving through publishing pipelines toward certification |

## Track record, technology, and what that implies for Light No Fire

The reveal framed Light No Fire as a fantasy survival sandbox set on a single shared planet at Earth scale, a deliberate inversion of No Man’s Sky’s many planet model, see the [official trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EurwCUKajdc) and the studio’s [announcement post](https://hellogames.org/2023/12/12/announcing-light-no-fire/). In 2025, Sean Murray underlined that the world will feature “real oceans” that require large boats and crews to cross, a concrete statement about simulation scope rather than a marketing slogan, covered here by [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/sean-murray-says-the-earth-sized-planet-in-light-no-fire-will-have-real-oceans-that-players-will-need-large-boats-and-crews-to-cross/). This speaks to how Hello Games manages risk with a lean team, it often proves complex systems in a live codebase before shipping them in a new title, a habit visible across years of No Man’s Sky updates. Skeptics will recall the bumpy 2016 launch, supporters will point to the studio’s sustained cadence and long term maintenance, both can be true, the relevant takeaway for Light No Fire is that capability talk tends to arrive well before calendar talk.

The studio does not publish a live headcount, public sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Games) and historical interviews suggest a modest team that scales up and down around milestones, the careers hub lists active openings and gives the clearest real time picture of focus areas, see [Join Us](https://hellogames.org/join-us/).

**Why trust this overview**  
This guide links only to primary or reputable sources, official pages, press materials, and established outlets, it distinguishes observation from inference, and it explains which signals will confirm or falsify the analysis as development moves forward.
