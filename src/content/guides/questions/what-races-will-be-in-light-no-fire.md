- **Bunny, Confidence: 100%** | **Goat, Confidence: 50%** <br>
This screenshot is from the first frames of the trailer. It already shows us alot. The most right character looks like a bunny, while the furthes left looks like a goat. Tho the Goat could just be a helmet another Race is wearing. The 2 character in the middle look pretty Human alike, one wears a hood, which makes the ssumption more unconfident, so we will leave those two.

> <img src="/images/int_map/full/biome_wastelands.webp" alt="Wastelands and three Skeletons walking." width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
- **Skeleton, Confidence: 80%** <br>
This screenshot shows some skeletons walking thorugh [Wastelands](/light-no-fire-map/#biome_wastelands). It wears a Sword on its back and looks like having a blue status effect, maybe a buff from a Potion. This could mean the Sekeleton Race could be playable. But this is not for sure. The Sekeletons we see could also just be a type of Enemy.

> <img src="/images/races/otter.webp" alt="An Ocean Scene with multiple creatures swimming" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/otter_close.webp" alt="A close shot of an Otter swimming" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /> 
- **Otter, Confidence: 90%** <br>
Looking at this image, we need a sharp eye to spot what we are looking for. What we are looking for could be an Otter. It's difficult to spot but the people are confident in saying this must be an otter. It sure looks like the otter is a master at swimming and is also wearing clothes, which again hints at the otter being playable.

> <img src="/images/races/bear.webp" alt="Scene with flowery highlands, mountain in the back, some characters in the front " width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/bear_close.webp" alt="Close shot of a bear looking Character" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
- **Bear, Confidence: 70%** <br>
So that right there is looking like some kind of forest animal. I think the head looks like a bear. Some internet sources may assume the same like [Lightnofirewiki.de](https://lightnofirewiki.de/light-no-fire-playable-races-2/light-no-fire-bear-race/). And again its wearing cloths and looks like a playable race. The Bear might be a bit stronger than other races.

> <img src="/images/races/badger.webp" alt="A boat waiting to traverse the Sea to a Island in the background" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/badger_close.webp" alt="Close shot of a badger waiting on the Boat." width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
- **Honey Badger or Racoon, Confidence 70%** <br>
It does look like the bear but with that remarkable fur coloring on it's head it looks just like a Honey Badger or a Racoong, we are not sure yet. Thats why we listed this Race differently. The Badger/Racoon is waiting for the other person on the Boat so it looks like a co-player, so likely a playable race.

> <img src="/images/races/fox.webp" alt="A rainy scene with some players walking towards a big statue" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/fox_close.webp" alt="Closeup Shot of one of the Players: the Fox" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
- **Fox, Confidence 80%** <br>
This Animal does look like a Fox and indeed is. We can see this animal relativly clearly in different angles and the face is definitly that of a fox. That remarkable Ears and Nose lets us identify the fox with high confidence. This Race will likely be agile and dodgy.
