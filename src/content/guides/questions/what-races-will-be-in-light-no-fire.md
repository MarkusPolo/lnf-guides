Hello Games shows some pretty interesting creatures that may look like playable races. That’s why we've covered every non-human-looking race in this article.

## Are there different Races in Light No Fire?
Most definitely, we've seen many creatures wearing clothes and armor, which leads us to think that at the start of the game you can choose a race for your character. We also think that these races differ in playstyles. While rabbits are small and speedy, bears are slow and mighty. But that's just a theory. No Man’s Sky’s races don’t differ in playstyle, so it could just be cosmetics. We've listed everything we saw in the trailer in the list below! You can also see our confidence score with them — while we're sure that there are bunnies, we are not so sure about the goats. See for yourself!

<div class="race-row">

</div>

- **Bunny, Confidence: 100%** | **Goat, Confidence: 50%** <br>
This screenshot is from the first frames of the trailer. It already shows us a lot. The rightmost character looks like a bunny, while the far-left one looks like a goat. Though the goat could just be a helmet another race is wearing. The two characters in the middle look pretty human-like — one wears a hood, which makes the assumption less confident, so we’ll leave those two.

<div class="race-row">
<img src="/images/int_map/full/biome_wastelands.webp" alt="Wastelands and three skeletons walking." width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
</div>

- **Skeleton, Confidence: 80%** <br>
This screenshot shows some skeletons walking through [Wastelands](/light-no-fire-map/#biome_wastelands). It wears a sword on its back and looks like it has a blue status effect, maybe a buff from a potion. This could mean the skeleton race could be playable. But this is not for sure. The skeletons we see could also just be a type of enemy.

<div class="race-row">
<img src="/images/races/otter.webp" alt="An ocean scene with multiple creatures swimming" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/otter_close.webp" alt="A close shot of an otter swimming" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /> 
</div>

- **Otter, Confidence: 90%** <br>
Looking at this image, we need a sharp eye to spot what we are looking for. What we are looking for could be an otter. It's difficult to spot, but people are confident in saying this must be an otter. It sure looks like the otter is a master at swimming and is also wearing clothes, which again hints at the otter being playable.
<br>
<div class="race-row">
<img src="/images/races/bear.webp" alt="Scene with flowery highlands, mountain in the back, some characters in the front" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/bear_close.webp" alt="Close shot of a bear-looking character" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
</div>

- **Bear, Confidence: 70%** <br>
So that right there looks like some kind of forest animal. I think the head looks like a bear. Some internet sources assume the same, like [Lightnofirewiki.de](https://lightnofirewiki.de/light-no-fire-playable-races-2/light-no-fire-bear-race/). And again, it's wearing clothes and looks like a playable race. The bear might be a bit stronger than other races.
<br>
<div class="race-row">
<img src="/images/races/badger.webp" alt="A boat waiting to traverse the sea to an island in the background" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/badger_close.webp" alt="Close shot of a badger waiting on the boat." width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
</div>

- **Honey Badger or Raccoon, Confidence: 70%** <br>
It does look like the bear, but with that remarkable fur coloring on its head, it looks just like a honey badger or a raccoon — we are not sure yet. That’s why we listed this race separately. The badger/raccoon is waiting for the other person on the boat, so it looks like a co-player, and therefore likely a playable race.
<br>
<div class="race-row">
<img src="/images/races/fox.webp" alt="A rainy scene with some players walking towards a big statue" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" /><img src="/images/races/fox_close.webp" alt="Close-up shot of one of the players: the fox" width="400" class="rounded-card shadow-soft" />
</div>

- **Fox, Confidence: 80%** <br>
This animal does look like a fox — and indeed is. We can see this animal relatively clearly from different angles, and the face is definitely that of a fox. The remarkable ears and nose let us identify the fox with high confidence. This race will likely be agile and dodgy.

## Are there Humans in Light No Fire?
We've seen a lot of human-looking players in the trailer. Because of how much we saw of them, we will cover them in another article. Light No Fire will feature humans for sure. Stay tuned for the next article!
