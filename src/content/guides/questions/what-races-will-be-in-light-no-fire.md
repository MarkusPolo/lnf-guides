Hello Games has a history of designing mysterious worlds full of hidden systems and layered lore. With *Light No Fire*, they seem to expand that ambition far beyond *No Man’s Sky*. Among the most exciting details from the reveal trailer are the many humanoid creatures — some distinctly animal-like — suggesting a diverse roster of playable races.  

In this article, we’ve taken a close, frame-by-frame look at the trailer and examined lighting, animation style, equipment, and environment context to identify every non-human character that might represent a playable race. Each entry includes a **confidence score** and **observational reasoning**, making it clear where speculation begins and ends.

## Are there different Races in Light No Fire?
Yes — almost certainly. Hello Games clearly wants *Light No Fire* to feel alive, and that means variety not only in landscapes but also in beings that inhabit them. Multiple humanoid figures in the trailer wear distinct armor and clothing adapted to different climates, which strongly implies selectable races at character creation.  

From a design standpoint, this makes perfect sense. A procedurally generated planet of this scale — which the developers describe as “the size of Earth” — would feel empty without cultural and biological diversity. Distinct races reinforce the sense of discovery that *Light No Fire* builds on.  

While it’s possible that the visual differences are purely cosmetic, the consistent use of posture, silhouette, and contextual animation hints at functional variation. For example, smaller, light-framed species appear agile, while heavier ones are slower but more physically imposing. That could mean different traversal advantages or passive traits, even if the core gameplay remains shared.

We’ve listed every identifiable non-human being below — with speculation clearly marked.

- **Bunny, Confidence: 100%** | **Goat, Confidence: 50%** <br>
The very first frames of the trailer already give us a lot to work with. On the right, a small, upright character with long ears and compact proportions — unmistakably a bunny. The animation is smooth and grounded, suggesting a playable model rather than an NPC. The bunny’s light outfit and gear make it plausible that this species excels in mobility or climbing.  

On the far left, we see what might be a goat-like creature — or a helmeted humanoid. The curved shapes could represent horns, but the texture doesn’t clearly separate fur from metal. Since Hello Games often blends organic and synthetic design elements, this could go either way. Still, it’s notable that both characters appear alongside humans, implying inter-species cooperation — a key indicator of player diversity.

- **Skeleton, Confidence: 80%** <br>
This is one of the most debated scenes. Three skeleton-like figures walk calmly through the [Wastelands](/light-no-fire-map/#biome_wastelands), each carrying a sword on their back. The way they move — upright, balanced, and coordinated — strongly suggests intelligence rather than hostility.  

The blue glow on one of them could indicate an energy or status effect. That, combined with their equipment, makes it very possible that we’re looking at a playable undead race rather than simple enemies. Thematically, this would align with Hello Games’ fascination for rebirth and persistence across worlds (a concept already explored in *No Man’s Sky’s* lore around consciousness transfer).  

It’s entirely plausible that skeletons are the remnants of an older civilization or explorers who somehow returned from death — a recurring motif in fantasy survival design.

- **Otter, Confidence: 90%** <br>
This one is easy to miss but too important to ignore. In a sequence showing an open ocean, one figure swims with distinctly animal-like grace — rolling, diving, and resurfacing naturally. The shape of the head, short snout, and slick movement pattern all point toward an otter-based species.  

If confirmed, this could be *Light No Fire’s* dedicated aquatic race — capable of extended underwater exploration. Given the game’s focus on seamless world traversal (from mountaintops to ocean depths), such a species would perfectly fit the broader design philosophy of “freedom through diversity.”  

The otter’s visible clothing — thin, flexible, and fabric-based — also contrasts sharply with heavy armor seen elsewhere, further reinforcing a specialized underwater or amphibious role.

- **Bear, Confidence: 70%** <br>
This large, fur-covered figure has a rounder body, broad shoulders, and a muzzle that clearly differs from human anatomy. The way it stands and moves — heavy steps, measured turns — indicates mass and strength. It looks like a bear or a bear-like humanoid.  

If the race is playable, it likely represents a high-endurance archetype. Hello Games might use it to balance lighter species by giving it slower mobility but greater damage resistance or carrying capacity.  

Several fan analyses, including one from [Lightnofirewiki.de](https://lightnofirewiki.de/light-no-fire-playable-races-2/light-no-fire-bear-race/), argue that this “bear race” might originate from mountainous biomes, perhaps tied to a crafting or defense-oriented culture. It’s a plausible interpretation, given Hello Games’ tendency to connect species visually to their environments.

- **Honey Badger or Raccoon, Confidence: 70%** <br>
At first, this character could be mistaken for the bear — similar body structure, same general size — but the fur coloring immediately sets it apart. The bright stripe across the head and darker face suggest either a honey badger or raccoon inspiration.  

The scene composition matters here: the badger-like figure stands calmly on a boat, waiting for another character. Both appear non-hostile, suggesting cooperative gameplay. That level of interactivity usually implies player characters, not NPCs.  

If we interpret this species functionally, it might represent adaptability — resourceful and balanced, perhaps specializing in exploration, navigation, or crafting. Hello Games often embeds subtle ecological metaphors into its design, and a scavenger-type race would fit that philosophy neatly.

- **Fox, Confidence: 80%** <br>
Among all the animal-inspired figures, the fox stands out as the most visually defined. Its long ears, sharp muzzle, and smooth fur texture clearly distinguish it from both humans and other creatures. The fox is seen walking upright in multiple scenes, maintaining a confident, balanced gait.  

The race’s appearance — lighter armor, slim silhouette — hints at agility-focused gameplay. If *Light No Fire* incorporates movement-based abilities or stealth mechanics, the fox could represent that archetype.  

Notably, Hello Games often ties creature design to environmental storytelling. The fox appears in rain-soaked ruins, walking toward a massive statue — imagery often used to convey intelligence and purpose. That alone increases our confidence that it’s more than background fauna.

## Are there Humans in Light No Fire?
Absolutely — and they seem to be the foundation on which the other races build. The trailer shows numerous human-like figures in varied armor and environments, from desert explorers to cloaked wanderers. Their prevalence suggests humans will serve as the baseline playable species, similar to how *No Man’s Sky* used Travelers as the primary player form.  

However, there’s a notable difference here: *Light No Fire* seems to place humans within a shared ecosystem rather than above it. The presence of anthropomorphic species alongside them hints at a world where evolution and magic — or technology — have blurred the boundaries between man and beast.  

We’ll dive into human-specific details, customization options, and lore speculation in an upcoming article. For now, it’s safe to say: **Humans are confirmed, but far from alone.** The diversity of races might end up being one of *Light No Fire’s* strongest expressions of identity and player freedom.
