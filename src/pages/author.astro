    <h1>About the Author</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>LNF Guides</strong> is an independent fan-driven project focused on
      collecting verified and speculative information, guides, and analyses about <em>Light No Fire</em>.
      Our goal is to provide clear, spoiler-safe resources for players of all levels.
    </p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This site is maintained by just me(at the moment), a No Mans Sky Veteran.
      I analyze official footage, developer statements, and in-game systems once available. I have a System Engineering Background and I'm playing alot of different Games. I love Survival Games, so as soon, as I saw Light No Fire's Trailer, I was hooked. By providing you with this content I'm able to get really invested into the game and share my excitement in guides and Articles with you.
    </p>

    <h2>Editorial policy</h2>
    <p>
      We always distinguish between verified information and speculation.
      All speculative elements are clearly marked and accompanied by a confidence score.
      We respect and acknowledge criticism in the provided Comments below every Article.
