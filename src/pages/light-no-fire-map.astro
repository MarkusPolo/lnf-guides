      <h2>Everything we know so far</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Light No Fire</strong> is described as adventure, building, survival and exploration on a
        <em>procedural, Earth-scale fantasy planet</em>, with multiplayer and persistent building. That means there
        won’t be a single, fixed minimap. This pre-release tool visualizes <em>what we can infer from public material</em>
        (mainly the first trailer) — biomes, structures, creatures and points of interest — and will be updated as new
        information emerges.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>How to read this map</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Markers</strong> are placed illustratively on a speculative base world image.</li>
        <li><strong>Confidence</strong> from 0.2 to 1.0 shows how certain a marker is.</li>
        <li>Sources link to the <em>timestamp or note</em> we used (e.g. “Trailer 01:07”).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What’s next</h3>
      <p>
        As we get more footage or dev info, we’ll add <strong>layer toggles, tag search and confidence filters</strong>.
        On launch, this tool will evolve into a <strong>community map</strong> (resources, creatures, player structures).
