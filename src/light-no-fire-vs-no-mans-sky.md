## Why compare Light No Fire and No Mans Sky

The Studio behind No Mans Sky is called [Hello Games](/guides/questions/who-is-making-light-no-fire/). Almost 2 Years Ago in December 2023, they announced, they are devoloping a new Game. [Light No FIre](/guides/questions/game-details-2025/). The Trailer now accumilated over 19 Million Views and spreat alot of Hype around it. Thats why we are discussing what their differences and similarities are. Every Studio has their own Style and their own Touch to their Games. If you played No Mans Sky before you may have seen a few visual similarities between both Games. The first time I saw the Trailer Light No Fire seems to be alot like it's older Sibling No Mans Sky. I have over 300h of Play Time in No Mans Sky myself and I've played since the Release.

## Characters

At first glance The Characters of No Mans Sky and Light No Fire don't look the same visually. But I think the walking animation in both games is pretty much the same.  The Characters probalby only vary in their Theme. Thats because the Settings of those games are very Different. I will cover more of the Setting later on. 

## Map Differences

This is probably the biggest difference between No Mans Sky and Light No Fire. No Mans Sky is set in a almost infinite Universe, with a dozen Galaxys and estimated 18 quintillion Planets. Which btw is more than 3 times the amount of grains of Sand on Earth. Light No Fire on the other hand is set on a single Fantasy Planet. Tho a really big Planet. Hello Games said it will be as big as our planet Earth itself. It would take over 300 days to walk the full length. This would also tackle a big Problem with No Man's Sky Map. Theoreticaly No Man's Sky is a Multiplayer Game. Tho stumbleing upon other Players is almost impossible. Light No Fire with it's rather smaller map compared to NMS has a better potential for real Multiplayer Gameplay. No Mans Sky received 2 Big World Overhaul updates in the past Year, which is likely tech they developed for Light No Fire. Those Updates made No Mans Sk absolutly Stunning. We already saw some parts of the Map in the Reveal Trailer, we put everything we saw onto a [speculative interactive Map](/light-no-fire-map) for you to explore.

## Gameplay Differences
